"Blurb," a haiku series
-----------------------

We all have a blurb
vast elevator pitches
for stories not there

the back of my book
crystal amber hope, below
seas and waves of tears

A lie, describing
sensation, not the mundane
branches but not roots

Critics' quotes describe
a tale that isn't quite there
gushing praise for 'strength'

Mundane moments hide
between the lines and the rhymes
plain to a bat's eyes
