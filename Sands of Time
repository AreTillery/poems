Sands of Time
---
Pattern made from sand;
impermanent permanence -
mark gone, presence felt

Friendship mandalas
blown by wind and breath and time -
away but not gone

Distant though we are,
aeolian and zephyr,
whisked this way and that...

Hearts - though distant - beat.
Time, space, provenance, and doubt
do not hold their sway.
