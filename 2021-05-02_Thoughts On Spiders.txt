Thoughts on Spiders
-------------------

You know how spiders' legs are held out through constant hydraulic pressure, so they have to constantly be flexing, and if they die their legs all curl in?
Mental health is kind of like that.





I don't know how compound eyes work.
I wish I could see the world like I imagine a spider does, but
I don't know how compound eyes work.
Seeing all those different angles, thinking three steps ahead, waiting for what I need to come to me, but
I don't know how compound eyes work.
I wish I had an important part of ecosystems, instead of destroying them, but
I don't know how compound eyes work.
The only spiders I have are in my brain, and I don't know how they work.





When a wheel spider gets scared, it tucks in its legs and rolls across the sand. Me too.
