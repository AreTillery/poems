Sometimes life feels like Jenga.
Teetering while towering
Knowing any second a piece will be out of place
Afraid, any moment, of collapsing

But at least a Jenga tower is solid, steady on its own.
It requires some outside force to poke and prod at its structure
Falling only when a player fails, not when it does

I am the tower and the player
Carefully placing blocks, seeking stability, but
knowing outside forces may be reckless with me
knowing I may make too many mistakes
knowing the tower may fall

But at least we can pick up the pieces
and play again
