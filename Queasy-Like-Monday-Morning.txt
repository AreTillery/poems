Queasy Like Monday Morning
--------------------------
My body and my brain moved too fast in opposite directions and now the person in the mirror isn't me.
Disassociate dysphoria before the scene turns gorier but even my digits and my limbs are not quite mine.
Watching from the outside inside out and laid to bare yet I'm a stranger even from myself.
I've always hated mirrors, then I started to not mind them, then here comes Monday morning... person.
And sure the stress helps causing it but my brain didn't need any help to not know who I am or what I do.
