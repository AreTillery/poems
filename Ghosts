Prompt from Omid: ghosts


            Spooky, scary, without form
        through the walls and through the door
    I hope I become one some day, watching my loves
  and knowing they      are okay      without me around
  or at least they      are what      okay can be after
loss. And then eventually okay. And I hope I see them love
me, in their memories, after I'm gone. And I hope they love
 after me. They are so many, and so great; they deserve it
To love and be loved until the end, when they become a ghost
 To spook and scare and watch and love along side me, along
    with their own new loves, that I can share with them
        the old and      the new        forever
