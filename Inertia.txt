Inertia
-------

Working too hard, I can't seem to play;
Inertia works both ways.
Don't get up too fast.
(I'm a metaphor enthusiast)

Like a blue hedgehog you gotta be quick;
the amount of energy you need is no picnic
but heaven forbid you slow down or you stop
taking damage from the wall as if you fell from the top

More words on paper 'til my point gets across
but my audience is still at a loss.
Mixing metaphors like I'm at a tiki bar
but my prolixity doesn't get me very far
