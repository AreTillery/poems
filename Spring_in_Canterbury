Prompt from Bryson:
Whan that aprill with his shoures soote
The droghte of march hath perced to the roote,
And bathed every veyne in swich licour
Of which vertu engendred is the flour.

O tale of Canterbury, more journey than destination,
long ago telling of the flaws and glories of archetypes still new.
Tell tale of rebirth in May, from flood of winter's procrastination
April bringing about precipitation, like our hearts, melted through.
We march on, the squire and knight, miller and monk, through careful calculation
The cold dagger of loss holds us, but still the days count too few.
Always out of reach, that final place, and yet we arrive in the basin;
the bosom of Spring giving way; Summery warmth within view.
Always marching on.
