Oh
--
Brought low by my own brain;
can't toe the line or even explain.
Internal row will be my bane
first sow, then split in twain.
Can't tow my way despite the strain
Can't throw in the towel, or even feign
But woe, what do I have to gain?
Borrow time because I must abstain,
hollow against the growing pain.
And lo, I don't mean to complain,
willow bent, but its shallow reign
road show will pass if I can contain.
Let go? Stop fighting as preordained?
You know the battle rages on this whisper campaign.
Shadow agents that are myself suffuse this plane.
And so I'll keep on loving, keep on fighting, and keep sane.
