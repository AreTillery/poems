Pressure
--------

Not everything has to be deep.
You don't have to stare at your hands
trying to find the perfect words.
Hoping the time sewn can be reaped.

Art can be silly
or shitty
or dull.
Not everything has to be deep.

I repeat the mantra, but I don't believe it;
That's for thee, not for me.
I have to be deep.
I have to be perfect.

Not everything has to be deep,
or meaningful
or even good.

Pressure forms diamonds,
but it can also shatter.
And imagine the pain carbon goes through to transform.

Not everything has to be deep.
Lift off the hook.
Relax.
Breathe.

Let it go.
Let it flow.

If only I would listen.
