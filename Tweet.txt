The birds are chirping
The end of the night, but the start of mine
Not the end of the world, but the end of mine.
I just want to go home, but I'm trapped in
This early morning late night place that I know.
A workaholic, but can't work through it - 
A pattern that repeats, bad habits only lost when drowned in new ones.
