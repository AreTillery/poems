What's so punny?
Not all "humor" is funny
But I don't do this for money

Laughter shows us love
and we share with our dear lovers
Communication's hard, and humor's a great cover

I wrote this because I love you but I'm not so good at talking
I know you know that too, but this one I will be chalking
up to my want for you to know for sure that to you I'm flocking

I love you with all my heart (not that love can be finite)
and writing and receiving this can make us both feel bright
I guess I'll end it here, I've rambled long enough - but I hope that in receiving it I've made your day (or night)
