I want to write about things that matter.
But most days I'm just on convincing myself I do.
Depression posting on main
good thing community isn't a zero-sum game - 
because I'd be in the negatives.

There's depth to delve
worthwhile thoughts in the dark behind the eyes
but I want to write about things that matter
instead of convincing myself I do.
I can be sad on my own time.

I read poems by John Lee Clark,
taking ableist works and erasing them until they're positive.
Taking darkness, and hate, and casual dismissal
and making something that matters.

I read Michael Torres
who made me cry by baring his soul.
Taking upbringing and culture and toxic masculinity
and making me feel so small, but made of so much.
Seeing pieces that I'd hidden within myself.
Making me want to write about things that matter
showing even the small pieces mean I do.

And I want to end on a positive, but all I have are selfish thoughts
and none of them go here.
because I want to write about things that matter.
