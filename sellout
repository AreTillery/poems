Sellout
-------
Of what use is it
trying to be creative
at ten cents per word?

Always counting up
and to five - and to seven
but out of balance.

Teetering, on edge...
success - in cents, or in sense -
is uphill both ways.

Of what use is it
forcing your own hand, your mind,
through mist and peat bog

Diabolical
roots barely pushing through stone
Abominable

Structure giving way
unidentifiable
madness edging in

Of what use is it
trying to be creative
at ten cents per word?
