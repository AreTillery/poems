You cannot escape the beating of the drums.
tho the rhythm may change, and their purpose may bend
the guitar and bass may shift rhythm with their strums --
You cannot escape the beating of the drums.
The chorus swells, orchestra thrums.
All songs conclude, surely this too must end!
You cannot escape the beating of the drums.
tho the rhythm may change, and their purpose may bend.
