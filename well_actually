"Well, actually"
----------------

**Inspiration is a well**
Sometimes the rain falls and seeps into the groundwater
But sometimes itâ€™s a flood, and only serves to wash away ground
Revealing how shallow we can be
Revealing how deep we feel

No pretty muse delivering grand images
Inspiration runs dry, and it flows readily, and it overflows
And it can be overdrawn
Or be plagued by drought

And sometimes you need to dig a new one.
