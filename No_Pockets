Written for Poem in Your Pocket day 2022

No Pockets
----------
I had a poem in my pocket
before I knew my gender
now I don't have pockets
so I don't write them down and just hope to remember.

Now my writing is longer
feelings too much to keep short
and I hold onto it longer
I hope to imbue it with import

Even if just for me
