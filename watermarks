Watermarks
----------
Papermarks in water
Floating lazily, imbued with the medium in which they rest.
Pollution in part, a page in a wave made of the discarded
Nearby, an obvious blemish on a tranquil surface
From a distance a dot, pointillism in abstract.

Watermarks on paper
Identify the source
Prove the integrity
Hide in plain sight
Sow distrust
Nearby, an obvious blemish on a tranquil surface
From a distance a dot, pointillism in abstract.
