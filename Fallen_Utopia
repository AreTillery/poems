Fallen Utopia
-------------
Making new molds just to pour ourselves into them
Never quite set 'cause we never did good in chem
breaking apart then breaking down into pure ylem
rebuild original sin because we can't stop growing hateful stems

We'll build a paradise avoiding the mistakes of the past
hope to accelerate the good, and the bad, well, we'll outlast
but all that's OBE because we're working from a bad forecast
our best work is uni- but our faults are always multicast

Throw up a firewall made of rules to keep the evil out
but it pretends to be ICMP and finds itself a faster route
think the evil's outside, but the packet's from inside the house
and just like that the shell is popped without anyone touching the mouse
