To speak of changing things is oft to scorn 
At that which cannot reach eternity.
But why should that which flows be so forlorn
And think of only what it cannot be?

The moon is not afraid to show in light
What must be seen to know it, all as one
Or turn away again in deepest night
To let the change come ready for the sun.

Some say it's dangerous to move too soon
I say instead things grow to meet their time
I change my face and think about the moon
For solid things to flow, a word: sublime.

We, velut Luna, change before our ends
And so we know it's not a phase, my friends
