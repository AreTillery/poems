It's not a phase
----------------

It's not a phase, mom
It's a pool, a lake, an ocean
beneath the surface.

Beneath the surface,
roots and branches and trunks and,
world, but not a phase.

Misfires abound here,
chemicals and receptors,
but not a phase, mom.

It's not a phase mom,
but god do I wish it was.
Disappearing moons.
