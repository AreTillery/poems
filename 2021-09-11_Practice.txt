Practice
--------
Practice makes perfect
so I guess we're good at feeling pain
I'm a sympathy addict
your interest melting like the salt in rain

I'm a Lot, dealing with all of my strife
You keep looking after me, you'll be doomed just like Lot's wife.

but you're like Job - always on the line
and I'm asking for your help - just one more time
It's not your job to save me from my pit of piteous self doubt
but I'm glad for having friends like you when I'm feeling down and out

I hope that you don't lose all the things around you that you hold and love
Break the curse of the accuser fallen, or from up above.
You sculpt my pillar back into something that resembles human
but have to hurry, make it quick, because the dark rain clouds are looming
