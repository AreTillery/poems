	For some reason I've been having weird bouts of insomnia off and on for the last few months. One night (this night, an hour and a half ago or so) I wrote this. Randomly. After reading Aasimov and some other assorted random fiction.


Insomniac ramblings, take 1
---------------------------

It was a dreary Monday. The kind that happen so often they're almost beyond mentioning in the mundanity that pervades the world of the working man. The day came without fanfare as all days do in the tedium of everyday life. But that day was the first of a long tradition of days marked by the passing of the supreme question, heretofore unheard and unuttered by the voice man. A simple question, its simplicity adding to the absurdity of the event, that such a dreary Monday might give rise to such a singularly interesting turn of events.

It had often been asked "where do we go from here," but never quite in the manner that it was asked on that day. Lewis turned to his neighbor, both reveling in the short break between tedious bouts of unimportant work, the kind that would keep one alive, but not pleasantly so, for many years. "How do you suppose it ends?" He didn't mean the day, or the year, or even the sporting event they had been so readily debating moments earlier.

It is said that in times of truth man can be struck with sudden inspiration so far outside himself as to be believed from the mouth and minds of the divine. Perhaps this was the case in the events surrounding the last days of the human race, so eagerly speculated around a break in the day's work one dreary Monday. But who was to know that one man's speculation might save the world?
