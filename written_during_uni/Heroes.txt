Heroes
------

What good are heroes when villains prevail
in a world where the good deeds and bad deeds are stale?
In a world where the question is not when but why
and the truth can be lost in the blink of an eye

Who needs heroes, when even the common man's lost;
when the you and the I won't act despite all the cost.
So stand up for yourself and your life and your dream
because heroes are useless and not what they seem.

We let Nothing prevail and sit back down for tea
and let Nothing take over from our apathy
and let Nothing be truth and be lost in the sea
but I'll tell you Nothing is not right for me.

Who needs heroes, when even the common man's lost;
when the you and the I won't act despite all the cost.
So stand up for yourself and your life and your dream
because heroes are useless and not what they seem.

The heroes are gone in the dust of our past
in a way that we knew quite frankly can't last
and we bided our time and we prayed for the best
and we sat back and waited -- not for us but the rest
to stand up and to act because hey, why should we
when the heroes will stand up and do it for free;
but the heroes are dead and the corpses are dust
so it's time for the you and the I to build trust

Who needs heroes, when even the common man's lost;
when the you and the I won't act despite all the cost.
So stand up for yourself and your life and your dream
because heroes are useless and not what they seem.
