	This came about an hour after the first, again out of the void that is sleep deprivation.
	Really it just started as that last line, only tweaked a bit. I wanted to write something with that line in it, and I have no idea why. The rest of it kind of flowed out, poetry-slam talking in weird rhythm style.


Insomniac ramblings, take 2
---------------------------

The air grows still
Time slows to a stop in the dim glow of the street lamp
The fairies of the tamed, cardboard jungle with the animals that sleep in the night.
It's wrong somehow to stir in the night against the natural order of the unnatural world we've built
Wrong somehow to stand up and stand back and take a stand for the life that leads itself
tick tick ticking to our doors.

The wind blows, its own subtle cry against the world we've built up so tall against the line of the sky we fight so hard to touch.
The wind, that carries the dust of a thousand years of demolition, that whispers the truth of a thousand more to come.
On the feet of creeping kittens come the fogs that roll, the truth that cannot be hidden.


In the yawning breadth of a yawning breath, the world can begin anew.
