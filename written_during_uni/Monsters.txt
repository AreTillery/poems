Monsters
--------

There's something magical about the night.
The cool crisp of the night air so pleasing to the skin.
Not like the sharp light of the day, burning the eyes,
flames licking the flesh.

Just cool enough to feel alive.
Drift away to another world
in the shadows. The shifting of a thousand unseen beasts.
Nothing to fear. They're just playing.
