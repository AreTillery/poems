	I'm not sure I like how this came out, particularly near the end. It just kind of drops off there without saying much of anything.
	I know it's horribly run-on-esque, but that's how it flowed as I was writing it. Pretend it's bad rap or something.


Truth
-----

I know that they say it's the light of truth shines
but the dark brings the truth of the sounds tween the lines
and the truth that was truth a'int the truth anymore
'cause there's my truth and your truth and the truth at the core
of the matter that brings out the doubt in us both
from the light and the lines and the sound that we quoth
and the matter is dead and we both know our way
but the end and we still don't know quite how to say
"I was right, you were wrong that's the end of the fact"
when we both learned to see the other's point left intact.
The trouble with learning to see all the sides
is that it's easy to get lost adjusting to tides
of the words and the thoughts that aren't foreign enough
to keep going and fighting and keeping it rough.
So we see and we hear in the dark and the light
and we'll just keep on going in day and in night.
