	I'm trying to get back into writing a bit. The best way I've found to do that is to just throw words on paper until something worthwhile comes out. Kind of like the photographer that takes 400 pictures and keeps 5.
	With that in mind, this is absolutely horrible. The rhythm shifts back and forth out of nowhere, and sometimes doesn't line up at all, and the rhymes are sketchy at best. But I don't like things fading into obscurity, so I'm posting it for posterity alone.


Faith
-----

I say correlation is not causation
you say those thoughts are only limitation
Nothing can be without impetus or force,
there has to be some power out there changing course.

I say to you 'it's only coincidence'
but you won't let that be.
'How long will you sit on the fence?
How long until you truly see?'


She says 'don't you see?'
as if there is no other way to be.
'The guiding force behind it all.'
am I too stubborn to disenthrall?

'Trust in him' the rally cry
with your faith, no question why.
But it's the questions that keep me sane.
Both can exist on the same plane.

Faith can be blind, like so many preach
or it can be in trust, something to teach.
Is faith just believing without knowing why?
Or is it in finding a source on which you can rely?

Is the truth the truth or just for you?
If more than one then can we know what's true?
