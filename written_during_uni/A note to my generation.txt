A note to my generation:
------------------------

Now is the time
The moment is now
step over the line,
we already know how.

The world here is changing
and we hold the key.
the questions are ranging
to be? not to be?

But we are the future;
in our hands it stands.
close up with a suture
and end the demand

For the war and the pain
and the fear in the world.
No more working in vain
without finger unfurled.

So stand up or step out
it's too late to stand still.
Don't cry and don't pout
find a more useful skill.
