Accompanying upload notes: How I wonder where you are


So too are Dreams
-----------------

Mountains, they stand, identifiable
against the backdrop of the rocky sky, turbulent
Backlit by the thunder-clap.

Mountains, they stand, indefatigable
lit with quiet brilliance in the spent
glow of a sunset's cap.

So too are dreams.
