Madness
-------

Shadows between the lines of the seen. There's fear there in shadows. The kind of fear we can't explain.

There's fear in the shadows. Fear of the unknown, but fear too of the known. How much is there that can drive a man mad? Are you mad for wanting to find out?

There's fear in the shadows. Creeping things just outside the realm of your sight, skirting the lights you point, without point, in their direction. The thoughts of the hours of thinking spent on the big ideas float through your mind. Generations of great thinkers answering life's questions to please their curious whim.

How many of them feared the shadows? How many were driven by the blending of the unknown, an amalgam of the emptiness and the lines that are so clear when the light strikes?

Are all such great minds mad?

Am I?
