Starlight
---------

Quiet nights pervade the countryside in this part of the world. The light and noise of the city is left far behind, replaced with the sounds of the trees and the wind and the birds and the bugs and the frogs and the silence that holds the world together in a place like this. This is the kind of place that the big city folks might come to so they can see the stars unclouded by the pollution they so readily bring on themselves, carrying their high dollar telescopes to see what we take for granted every night, spoiled perhaps by our patch of beauty.


This is the kind of place that lends itself to slower living, taking it a bit at a time. For a city boy that moved to the country, it's a different take on life. Not quite slower, just different, with those stars in the sky so ready to be seen, their light eager to catch the eye after a long journey.


What does the light dream of while we dream of the stars, their little bit of country so far off from their new home as a twinkle?
