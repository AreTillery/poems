Fitness Function
----------------
The wall stands still to strike so hard
I stand still, but hit it anyway.
On an autowalk to an escalator, sure as the great glass elevator, I hit the ceiling.

But when I run I'm standing still, a treadmill promising health and fitness but giving only exhaustion and a cold sweat.
My fitness function always returns 0.
