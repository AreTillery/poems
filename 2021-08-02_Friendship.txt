Friendship?
-----------
I give you silence because it's what you need
It seems I'm always the one to start -
Reaching out in the dark to grab hold to I don't know what.
But now the sound of my pulse in my ears is all I feel.

Waiting for you, to see how I fit in your puzzled life.
Patient impatience, wallflower on the wall clock.

I really hope you're ok
please tell me that you're ok.
