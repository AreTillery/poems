I'm afraid of the future
where my posthumanist dreams come true
because then the only excuse I have for fucking everything up
is me and my dumb brain.

My messed up body isn't an excuse
but it sure is a useful one.

we're everything we make of ourselves,
and an awful lot we don't.
And I wonder, if I don't remember my dreams now,
will I remember the electric sheep?

The other day, a stranger asked "who am I to you"
and I think that's a great question to ask of myself.

But I don't know what to make of the answer.
