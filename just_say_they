Just say they
-------------
Just say they.
You passively exclude when you could reach outside the aisles.
Fuck your tradition, fuck your habits, they're just an excuse to erase me.
"Ladies and gentlemen" has always been trite. "He or she" isn't progressive.
Just say they.
"But grammar" you say, ignorant of history, calling to order something that has never been.
"But it's hard" you say, like being ignored, being forgotten, isn't.
But that's not hard for YOU, so you don't care.
I guess it's no surprise, since you "try" but forget my gender a dozen times a day
but fuck, just say "they".
