Broad Strokes

I want to make art.
I'm not sure what art is, and I don't feel artistic, but
I want to make art.
I want to express and to feel and be optimistic, but
I want to make art
and I don't know how. I hide and I say that I'm logistic, but
I want to make art.
And I know art isn't always beautiful, that's unrealistic, but
I want to make art
for myself, as much as others; it isn't altruistic, but
I want to make art.
And I don't even know what that means.
