Quarantine
----------
No one's home, even though we never seem to go nowhere
I'm too busy staring through my eyes in the mirror
I've never met a metaphor with depth like those blue pools
but there's something about them that keeps playing me for a fool.
Because what I see reflected in the reflection of my eyes
is not the same reflection light reflecting would imply

And everyone sees each other different than how we see our selves
and even introspection cannot seem to beyond the surface delve
Will I ever see the truth or am I destined for more lies
I know for certain just one thing - the answer isn't in my eyes.
