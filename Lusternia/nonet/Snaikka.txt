Author's note: This poem is based on Snaikka, a historically-important non-player character in Lusternia.

Snaikka
-------
Snaikka's lab is where science happens.
Drawing blood and taking samples.
Scientific advances.
Give in to her research.
Science must advance!
It can't be stopped!
Draw the blood!
Slice flesh!
Learn!
