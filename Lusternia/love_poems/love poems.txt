Author's note: These poems were written on the topic of "love" with the prompt/theme "snakes and serpents"


Roses are red
Violets are blue
Don't turn your back
Or I'll poison you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thorns on the Vine, like
Snakes in the grass, like
The poison in wine;
Surprises en masse

Good love is on its toes
Friends get so bored
Good love is made of foes
That's why I'm so adored.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wrapped around the heart
Insinuating, squeezing --
Snakes love in secret.
