Author's note: This poem is based on Magnagora, a citystate in Lusternia. The following note from an in-character perspective was included with the poem: "The first describes the history and stories that arose around the Cay of Cloadahi, warped by word of mouth over years."


Coarsely
--------
Ace acres are also arcs.
Cay arose arcs; oral lore royal rose.

Sayer says scary sea slayer yea years rose,
Coal eras cry; coarse ears sear.

Oleas lay lacy; coy cores sorely rely.
Years layer lore. Leary lyre oracles coarsely carol cares.
