Author's note: This poem is based on Magnagora, a citystate in Lusternia. The following note from an in-character perspective was included with the poem: "Next, a treatise on advancement and its costs."


Coarsely
--------
Arson artists disanoint utilitarian strata;
Nation nor nationalist intuit industrial data

Untraditional dilutions trial solitarian iron rituals.
Inlaid iron initiation inlaid; industrialization

Its island lair laid rational, nation sat in situational sin.
Soil slain in iron talon.
