For a while, I played an online roleplaying multi-user dungeon (MUD) called [Lusternia](https://www.lusternia.com/). One of the things Lusternia encourages quite a bit is the creation of original literary works related to the game (and written from an in-character perspective). The citystate your character belongs to can benefit from the publication of these written works, falling into either "Scholarly" (research-driven based on in-character lore) works and "Literary" (creativity-based prose and poetry from an in-character perspective) works.

I wrote the stuff in this directory over time. Some of it I actually like, some of it I just kind of forced out for points.
