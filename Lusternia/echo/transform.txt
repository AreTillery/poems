Author's note: This poem is based on Magnagora, a citystate in Lusternia. 


Transform
---------
Shadows overcast, last
hint of light stamped out by smog. Dog
bitten scraps of food tossed aside; tied
with the dirt, ignored even by the beggars' hands. Lands
taken by the taint, transformed into something new. Clue
upon clue hint to the greater purpose here. Leer
at those that fight against transformation. Station
means much, here, but ability matters too. Who
could rise in such an Engine without breeding? Feeding
the Engine of Transformation as it rolls over the weak. Seek
not power, but purpose. Rise up and become better. Transform.
