Author's note: This poem was written with the prompt/theme "snakes and serpents"

A snake is a surgeon wrapped in scales,
Its fangs the needle that pierces your veins,
Healing you of all that sickens and ails.
A snake is a surgeon wrapped in scales
Who swiftly frees you from the world's travails.
A hiss, a bite, and away your suffering drains.
A snake is a surgeon wrapped in scales,
Its fangs the needle that pierces your veins.
