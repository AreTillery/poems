Author's note: This poem is based on Magnagora, a citystate in Lusternia.


Lamplight
--------
The lamps in Magnagora dimmed.
Smog clung to their clothes, their lungs, and
rats bit at their ankles and toes.
Morning came. Not for them; for us.

Joy left them as they were struck down.
The lamps in Magnagora dimmed.
Risen wights to join the city guard,
Enemies get no quarter here.

The clocktower long ago struck.
Midnight had come, and like them gone.
The lamps in Magnagora dimmed.
The sun rose on fallen bodies.

The last lived, now on the ramparts.
But soon, his neck too was severed.
As his head tumbled down below,
The lamps in Magnagora dimmed.
