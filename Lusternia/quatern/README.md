These poems follow the [Quatern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion_(poetry)) format - sixteen lines organised into four quatrains, or stanzas of four lines, with eight syllables to each line. The first line of the first stanza is the refrain; in the second stanza, the second line contains the refrain; in the third stanza, the refrain becomes the third line; and in the fourth stanza, the refrain forms the fourth and final line of the poem.
