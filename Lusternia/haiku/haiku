Author's note: These poems were written with the prompt/theme "snakes and serpents"


ON FOOT
-------
serpents you can trust.
underfoot, they slither by;
they strike when needed.

RIBBON
------
ribbon in the wind
twirls and bends sinuously --
snakes alight the sky

DEFENESTRATION
--------------
the mongoose, so dull
rose up to be struck back down
pushed through the window

EARTH, AS WITH THE SERPENT
--------------------------
tainted earth beneath.
tread carefully, mountains strike;
unwelcome feet fall
