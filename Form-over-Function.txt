Form Over Function
------------------
psychosomatically actually killing it
eating icing straight from the filling kit
while I can't sleep 'cause my brain's distilling shit.

Getting help by first posting this thrilling writ
and then finding some minions with willing grit.
Trying to manifest greatness like top billing Brits.
But the plan's fishy, makes me feel like a gilling - slit.

---

I'm never quite happy with how things go
never like the speed of my wings and zings - slow
so I must bear all of the slings and arrows

The plan has gone south and still no sleep
No help from the likes of little Bo Peep
and medicinal herbs just don't grow cheap
night signaled a vote of no confidence from the crow veep.


Of night's slings and night's arrows I've had my fill
gone hoarse from the screaming so out I cry shrill
and all of this tumbles out of thy shy quill

the sandman has come and gone without visit
Once, now twice, the lantern 'bout is lit
Two whole days without sleep and even format has left me.
