If moments are grains of sand
and lives a beach, borne in and out on waves of fate
memories, then, are the smoothed, old, ancient fine sand
Once large
     but worn down with life
         until only a core remains
The rest, broken down, spread out throughout our beach
               but impossible to find
                   to link
                      to reconstruct
