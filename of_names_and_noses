Of Names and Noses
------------------
The Name is not the Thing named.
And by another name, so sweet it is,
but the Tao says naming is the origin of all
_particular_
things.

Am I particular? Peculiar?
Caught in desire, seeing only manifestations of dreaming?

Maybe (just maybe) I am
the mystery.
The rose, or the sweet, or
    the manifestation
            in the
                of the
                    darkness.

The me that can be told
but also the true me.
The Name
        but also the Thing named.
