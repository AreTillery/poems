The Chronic
-----------
I struggle through the bad days like I'm going through withdrawal.
For me, not being in pain is an addiction.
A high I'm chasing with seven prescriptions a day.
I call it my seven nation army, but like the song says, they can't hold it back.

Decades for diagnoses that give comfort solely by removing uncertainty
-- and dulling the worst of it. But never all of it.
Chasing those good days by holding them in my vision like that dream that's always just out of reach.
Imagine how that shapes my other dreams.

And the thing is, I like my life. I'm happy, mostly,
and successful, by a lot of measures,
and damn lucky (by privilege and by effort and by serendipity).
But it's always tinged by that withdrawal, by chasing that addiction
to just feeling normal for a day.
